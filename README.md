# Overview
This chatbot is a simple conversational agent that interacts with users based on predefined patterns and responses. It uses natural language processing techniques to understand user input and generate appropriate responses.

## Features
Pattern-Response Matching: The chatbot matches user input against predefined patterns and responds with corresponding messages.

## Preprocessing: User input undergoes tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to improve pattern matching accuracy.
User Interaction: The chatbot engages in a conversation with the user until the user decides to exit.
Usage
To use the chatbot, prepare a data file (Data.txt) with tab-separated patterns and responses. Each line in the file should contain one pattern and its corresponding response.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
NLTK library for natural language processing tasks.

## Troubleshooting
Formatting Issues: Ensure that your Data.txt file is correctly formatted with one tab-separated pattern and response per line.
Permission Errors: If you encounter permission errors while accessing the data file, make sure you have the necessary permissions to read the file.
